# Description
A stream cipher based on the Sha-1 hash function.The project is divided into two modules:


-Encryption Module-decryption Module
-Sharing of keys over the netowrk

# Encryption Module
![here H(t) is the hash text and P(t) is the plain text which we want to enxrypt](1.png "Image Title")
![Stream cipher encryption chart basic XOR based](2.png "Image Title")

# Module-2
which is sharing of key with the cipher text over the network is in development.
 
## Dependency
 The program is written from the scratch till know, so every algorithm i used is programmed by me

## Usage
Open app.py and write your plain text which you want to encrypt and write the hash message which will generate your key
automatically and encrypt the text
