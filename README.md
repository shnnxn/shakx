# Description
A stream cipher based on the Sha-1 hash function.The project is divided into two modules:

 -Encryption Module
 -Sharing of keys over the netowrk

# Encryption Module
![here H(t) is the hash text and P(t) is the plain text which we want to enxrypt](1.png "Image Title")
![Stream cipher encryption chart basic XOR based](2.png "Image Title")
